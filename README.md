# Abandoned -> Moving to Purescript.

This repository will not be maintained anymore.

## Why we are moving to PureScript?

Elm is simple and easy and has a "The Elm Architecture" when we are working on a complex project, we end up writing a lot of boiler plate code. PureScript JsonDecode and JsonEncode code is super simple and easy! Elm not so!

PureScript, is perfect for us, as it supports TypeClasses, Higher Kinded Types etc.

Also, the most important thing is... PureScript compiles to JavaScript and what we do with that is up to us. Elm is very focused on UI. Elm is more an UI library rather than a general programming language!

Another major thing is... there are too many breaking changes between versions. I spent quiet a bit of time with 0.14, 0.15, 0.16 and then again I had to understand everything in 0.17 and this is continuing in 0.18. I believe that this will continue! The amount of effort required to understand the internals of Elm and developing and maintaining this library is a huge task.

We loved signals and planned many things based on that... now its not even available in Elm anymore.

The same time & effort invested in PureScript is giving us returns in multiple magnitudes.
